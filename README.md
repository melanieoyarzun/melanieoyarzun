### Hi there 👋, I'm Melanie

I'm a Chilean 🇨🇱 doctoral researcher, pursuing a Phd in Social Complexity [@CICS](https://complejidadsocial.udd.cl) Universidad del Desarrollo 

🔍 My research focus on exploring social dynamics within educational environments and their impact on students' success, coexistence, and society at large.

📚 With a background in Econometrics, I work at the intersection of social and computational sciences, employing quantitative analysis, social networks, experimental game theory, and causal inference to comprehend critical themes such as reciprocity, cooperation, social hierarchy, and friendship. 

🚀 My aim is to produce high-impact research to contribute data-driven solutions to society, educational efforts, and the design of educational policies.

Currently, I'm exploring the role of social interaction patterns among students using computational methods such as experimental game theory and network analysis. 


My ongoing research sheds light on the connections between reciprocity, cooperation, and academic outcomes. In addition, I'm excitedly collaborating on projects at the Center for Collective Learning, University of Toulouse, focusing on collective memory and the measurement of popularity.

🚀 My Current Projects:

1. **Exploring Social Interaction Patterns in Education:** Investigating how social interactions among students influence learning outcomes and contribute to a collaborative classroom environment.

2. **Stemming Dropout Rates in STEM:** Unraveling the social dynamics that impact student persistence in STEM fields, with the aim of enhancing educational pathways and fostering diversity.

🌱 I'm enthusiastic about continuous learning, collaboration, and data-driven insights. Feel free to explore my GitHub repositories to find out more about my research, projects, and contributions to the exciting field of complex social sciences.

Happy coding! 📚🔬🌟
